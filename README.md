## About

This respository contains code that does 3 things:

1. Clean & munge data (which it gets from this [Ski-VT]([http://www.uvm.edu/skivt-l/?Page=depths.php) page) data)
2. Persist data to this repository, by pushing to git via a scheduled script (kicked off by cron)
3. A web app that displays the data
